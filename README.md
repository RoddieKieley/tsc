## Technical Charter (the “Charter”) for Open 3D Engine Foundation a Series of LF Projects, LLC, Adopted July 6, 2021

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for
technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Open 3D Engine open
source project, which has been established as Open 3D Engine
Foundation, a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”). LF Projects,
LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. The
Project is supported and managed by the Open 3D Engine Fund (the
“Fund”), a directed fund of the Linux Foundation, an Oregon mutual
benefit corporation. All contributors (including committers,
maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in
the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms
of this Charter.

1.  ## Mission and Scope of the Project

    a.  The mission of the Project is to make a fully-featured, high-fidelity, realtime 3D engine for building games and simulations.

    b.  The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.

2.  ## Values:

    a.  Neutral. The Project seeks to be neutral to all technologies and
        companies, and strives to design interfaces and systems to be as
        universal and unencumbered as possible to enable any
        organization can incorporate their technology with the Project.

    b.  Industry agnostic. Even though the Project began as a game
        development engine, the Project strives to enable other
        industries to take advantage of the advances it may provide for
        them.

    c.  Open. The Project is open, transparent and accessible, and
        operates independently of specific partisan interests. The
        Project accepts all contributors based on the merit of their
        contributions.

    d.  Easy to adopt. The Project seeks to make onboarding materials as
        up to date and accessible as possible.

    e.  Fair. The Project will avoid undue influence, bad behavior and
        “pay-to-play” decision-making.

    f.  Modular. The Project strives to facilitate extensibility is done
        in a modular manner outside of the core engine, to minimize
        changes that may break compatibility with applications built on
        top of the core engine.

    g.  Platform-agnostic. Platform specifications will be developed to
        not be platform–specific, such that the Project can be
        implemented on a variety of architectures and operating systems.

3.  ## Technical Steering Committee

    a.  The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible
        for all technical oversight of the Project.

    b.  Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to
        be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via
        teleconference, or in person.

    c.  TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers.
        The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are
        documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise
        documented:

        i.  “Contributors” include anyone in the technical community
            that contributes code, documentation, or other technical
            artifacts to the Project;

        ii.  “Committers” are Contributors who have earned the ability to
            modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other
            technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and

        iii.  A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval
            of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a
            majority approval of the other existing Committers.

    d.  Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and
        Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms
        of this Charter.

    e.  The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the
        submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set
        requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer
        status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or
        eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create
        new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

    f.  The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of
        the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by
        the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by
        the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between
        the Project and the Fund. Elections of a TSC Chair will require
        a two-thirds vote of all of the members of the TSC.

    g.  Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of
        technical oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

        i.  coordinating the technical direction of the Project;

        ii.  approving project or system proposals (including, but not
            limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a
            sub-project’s scope);

        iii.  organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;

        iv.  creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on
            cross-project technical issues and requirements;

        v.  appointing representatives to work with other open source or
            open standards communities;

        vi.  establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases,
            and security issue reporting policies;

        vii.  approving and implementing policies and processes for
            contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and
            coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as
            provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager to
            resolve matters or concerns that may arise in implementing
            Section 9 of this Charter;

        viii.  discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting
            on technical matters relating to the code base that affect
            multiple projects; and

        ix.  coordinating any marketing, events, or communications
            regarding the Project with the Fund.

4.  ## TSC Membership

    a.  The TSC voting members are initially those individuals listed as
        voting members of the TSC on the Project web site.

    b.  To be a qualified for a seat on the TSC, an individual must:

        i.  commit that they have the available bandwidth to make the
            time to invest in the Project and the TSC,

        ii.  demonstrate an advanced level of professional experience as
            engineers in the scope of Project,

        iii.  demonstrate seniority sufficient to access additional staff
            or community members to assist in their TSC preparations
            and,

        iv.  operate neutrally in discussions and put the goals and
            success of Project overall in balance with corporate
            objectives or any particular project in the Project.

    c.  From the inception of the Project to the date that is eighteen
        months following inception of the Project or such other
        appropriate date determined by the TSC, such as the point after
        which a majority of contributions have been made by new
        contributors to the Project (the “Transition Date”), the makeup
        of the TSC will be determined as follows:

        i.  Four members selected by the Governing Board of the Fund;
            and

        ii.  Five members determined via a process to be approved by the
            TSC.

    d.  After the Transition Date:

        i.  The composition of the TSC will be as determined by the TSC
            by two-thirds majority vote (subject to subsections (ii)
            and (iii) below) and documented on the Project web site or
            code repositories.

        ii.  no more than three (3) members of the TSC may be employed,
            directly or indirectly (e.g., as a contractor), by any one
            entity and its Affiliates (either at the time of election or
            from a later job change);

        iii.  and if at any time more than three (3) members are so
            employed by the same entity and its Affiliates, then they
            will jointly decide who should step down, or if there is no
            agreement, random lots shall be drawn.

> “Affiliate” means, with respect to any entity, any other entity that
> directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common
> control with that entity.

5.  ## TSC Voting

    a.  While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based
        community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the
        Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a
        one vote per voting member basis.

    b.  Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all
        voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to
        meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any
        decisions at the meeting.

    c.  Except as provided in Section 3.f., 9.c. and 10, decisions by
        vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in
        attendance, provided quorum is met. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, the TSC may decide to use a lazy consensus model for
        regular votes of the TSC, provided that such lazy consensus
        model is documented on the Project web site. Decisions made by
        electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all
        voting members of the TSC.

    d.  In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting
        member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for
        assistance in reaching a resolution.

6.  ## Compliance with Policies 

    a.  This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project
        and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will
        comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and
        amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the
        policies listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/.

    b.  The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project,
        which is subject to approval by the Series Manager. In the event
        that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF
        Projects Code of Conduct listed at
        [<u>https://lfprojects.org/policies</u>](https://lfprojects.org/policies)
        will apply for all Collaborators in the Project.

    c.  When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project,
        LF Projects will publish such policy, as to be amended or
        adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy
        taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any
        amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF
        Projects, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF
        Project’s web site.

    d.  All Collaborators must allow open participation from any
        individual or organization meeting the requirements for
        contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all
        Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests.
        Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude
        any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason
        other than those that are reasonable and applied on a
        non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Project
        community.

    e.  The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative,
        and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project
        discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should
        be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations
        of this requirement should be reported immediately to the
        Governing Board.

    a.  LF Projects will hold title to all trade or service marks used
        by the Project (“Project Trademarks”), whether based on common
        law or registered rights. New Project Trademarks will be
        transferred and assigned to LF Projects to hold on behalf of the
        Project. Any use of any Project Trademarks by Collaborators in
        the Project will be in accordance with the license from LF
        Projects and inure to the benefit of LF Projects.

    b.  The Project will, as permitted and in accordance with such
        license from LF Projects, develop and own all Project GitHub and
        social media accounts, and domain name registrations created by
        the Project community.

    c.  Under no circumstances will LF Projects be expected or required
        to undertake any action on behalf of the Project that is
        inconsistent with the tax-exempt status or purpose, as
        applicable, of LFP, Inc. or LF Projects, LLC.

8.  ## General Rules and Operations. 

    a.  Conduct. The Project will:

        i.  engage in the work of the Project in a professional manner
            consistent with maintaining a cohesive community, while also
