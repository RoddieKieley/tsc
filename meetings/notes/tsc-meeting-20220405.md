## Sig-simulation Charter Discussion

Reviewed revised charter and discussed minor feedback:

- Goals may need to be authored more as "north stars" as opposed to specific goals with attached timelines
- Scope likely should include content-creator tooling/scripting interfaces to simulation systems
- Clarify the "out-of-scope" section to add additional clarity about simulation scope (e.g. scene BSP/octree?)

Action item: Goal is to finalize charter and kick off election for sig-simulation chair and co-chair _next week_ (2022-04-12)
