## Release Cadence discussion

Joe B (Ulrick28) - Proposed future releases: mid-april-mid-may, mid october-mid-november
  - Avoid major holidays
  - Align with pillar features
  - 6 months instead of 3 months to reduce overhead

Specific cadence needed for
  - Marketing lead time (blog posts, other materials)
  - Sig coordination
  - QA (this is the primary overhead when doing a release)

Royal:
  - 6 month cadence gives fewer opportunities to engage community that only uses the official releases
  - Coincident with o3decon for second release (we can push this earlier)

Discussion around dates (how do we know when we're ready)
More frequent releases may require more resources (inhibits ability to do other things in the meantime)
Operational overhead (updating website, binaries, installers, documentation, release notes, etc.)

Emergent question: how do we keep the development branch more stable

Karl:
  - Notes the difficulties with respect to "continuously shippable" projects, which may be difficult or even infeasible for a project with the scope of O3DE

Terry:
  - Note: more frequent releases equates to shorter stabilization periods (but keep in mind fixed costs also)

Nick:
  - Better stabilization will come from better test coverage + having a project everyone can hammer on
