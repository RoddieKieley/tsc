# O3DE TSC - Meetings

## Meetings

Meetings are held weekly on Tuesdays at 8am PT on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GY27aVzvmh) in the `#tac-tsc` voice channel. The meetings serve to:

- Provide guidance on engaging in O3DE's development process
- Reviewing existing processes and mechanisms
- Proposing or discussing new changes to streamline development
- Fielding questions from the community or helping to resolve any emergent issues and roadblocks

## Who Can Attend

Everyone, regardless of membership within the TSC itself, is welcome to attend. If you would like to simply observe the meeting
proceedings, you may show up unannounced at your leisure. If you would like to ask a question or have an agenda item you would
like to discuss, please write a comment in the corresponding agenda [issue](https://github.com/o3de/tsc/issues) which is generally posted ahead
of the meeting.

## Notes

Meeting notes will generally committed on the same day to this repo.
